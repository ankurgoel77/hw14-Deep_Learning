1. Which model has  lower loss?
> The closing price model had a lower loss of 0.0551 vs the FNG model loss of 0.0698

2. Which model tracks the actual values better over time?
> It looks like the the closing price predictor did better with actual values over time, as it did increase with the real trend, while the FNG was lumpy and tended to decrease.

3. Which window size works best for each model?
> Window size of 10 worked better than any size below 10.  Trying with 5, the predicted model curves became flatter with very little predictive power on the price increase in Bitcoin
